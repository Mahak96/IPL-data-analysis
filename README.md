
# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a student project that analyzes **IPL cricket data** to find insights about players, teams, and matches. The project uses **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib** to process and visualize the data.

## 📂 Files in the Project
- **data/** → Contains CSV files with IPL match details.
- **notebook/** → Jupyter Notebook where all the analysis is done.
- **requirement.txt** → List of Python libraries needed to run the project.

## 📊 What This Project Does
✅ Finds the top-performing batsmen and bowlers.
✅ Analyzes team performance over seasons.
✅ Shows trends in match outcomes.
✅ Creates graphs and charts for better understanding.
